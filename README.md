🚀 Java Core & Advanced Practice Hub
Welcome to my Java Mastery repository! This project is a curated collection of my practice files, focusing on core Java principles, the Collections Framework, modern Java 8+ features, and fundamental Data Structures.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate clean coding practices, logical thinking, and a deep understanding of Java's internal workings.

📖 About the Project
This repository serves as a personal knowledge base where I implement and document everything I've learned in Java. From basic syntax to advanced topics like the Stream API and Generics, every package represents a step forward in my learning journey.

🛠 Key Concepts Covered
1. Generics
Implementation of type-safe classes and methods.

Understanding Wildcards (?, extends, super).

2. Java Collections Framework
List: ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector implementations.

Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet (Ordering vs Sorting).

Map: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Queue & Stack: PriorityQueues, Deques, and custom Stack logic.

3. Stream API (Java 8+)
Functional programming using filter(), map(), and flatMap().

Data aggregation using reduce() and collect().

Parallel Streams for performance optimization.

4. Data Structures (DSA)
Custom implementations of Stack and Queue.

Logical problem-solving using Collections.
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher.

An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

Installation
Clone the repository:
